Have rfvar and svar, two programs that estimate var's using dummy observation 
priors, but without normalizing the prior, and thus possibly with improper 
priors.  Both call varprior to set up dummy obs.  (I.e., need to remove 
rfvar3's redundant generation of dobs.  

Then rfmdd (new name for mgnldnsty) and svarmdd use the first two above, 
respectively, to calculate mdd's with normalized priors.

svar takes A0 and lmd as given, uses equation-by-equation fit, allows weighted 
observations.  (via lmd.  Separately as t-errors, or just dim(lmd)[2]==T?

rfvar uses svd, so can handle singular rhs matrix, uses default prior with mu 
and lambda only.

Above can all be done on one git branch.
--------------------------------------------------
bvarwrap:  include A0,lmd prior parameters in parameter list.
restore t-errors option?  Or is Tsigbrk==1:T enough?
---------------------------------------------------
postdraw, SVARpostdraw, irfband, plotir:  plotir() is used by irfBand.  It 
does the actual layout and plotting.  Both postdraw programs gnerate draws from 
the posterior on coefficients.  The rf version does Gibbs sampling starting from 
somewhere near the peak.  The SVAR version uses draws of A0 and lmd already 
generated via some form of MCMC, to generate draws of the rf coefficients, 
accompanied by the corresponding A and lmd.  The reason for 
doing this in two steps is that, because we can draw easily from the exact 
conditional distribution, we need only a thinned version of the A, lmd draws to 
work from.  
-------------------------------------------
fcastBand() should, like irfBand, recognize SVAR vs rf pdout arg, so that 
population of smat with A0i not needed outside the program.
---------------------------------
There should be a function (not, as curently, just a script) to do 
the A, lmd draws 
-----------------------------------------------------
There should be programs that manage the pparams list and its defaults. There 
should also be a similar program and list for parameters governing the A0, lmd 
prior.

panel var project.  Need to allow cross-country variation in parameters, but 
with shrinkage toward a common form.  But also need a better way to introduce 
cross-country effects.
